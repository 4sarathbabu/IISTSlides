           Guidelines for beamerthemeiist.sty LaTeX Template 
           -------------------------------------------------
               https://github.com/4sarathbabu/IISTSlides

               
The template 'beamerthemeiist.sty' is developed to create presentation
slides using LaTeX with IIST flavor. The theme includes IIST logo and
other related information in the title slide. Appropriate comments are
provided in the style file so that the style can be easily customized
according to your wish.

Note: There is no compulsion to use this theme.


1. Prerequisite for the theme
-----------------------------

For using the theme (or creating any LaTeX documents), it is 
recommended to install the complete LaTeX package instead of the 
minimal version. The instructions to install complete LaTeX software 
is provided in the following link:

https://4sarathbabu.github.io/uploads/2018/p1_LaTeX_Instructions.pdf


2. How to start with the theme?
-------------------------------

The main LaTeX source is provided in the file 'pres.tex' with
appropriate comments. You can add your content in 'pres.tex' and
compile it using pdflatex or using the options provided by your LaTeX
editor.

The credentials of your slides (i.e., title, author(s), advisor(s),
and date) need to be provided using the following commands:

Document Title: \title[]{}
Author: \author[]{}
Advisor: \advisor{Research advisor}{Name}
Date: \date{}

The theme is designed in such a way that presentation title and author
name appear in each slide at the bottom along with date and slide
counter. In some cases (for example, if your title is too long or the
presentation has multiple authors), there may not be sufficient space
at the bottom of the slides to accommodate title and authors list. In
such cases, you can use short title or short names for authors instead
of using the complete name. You can use square brackets provided in
commands '\title' and '\author' to provide short titles and short
names. As an example, consider the following commands.

\title[Psychopathology]{The Psychopathology of Everyday Life}

\author[S. Freud]{Sigmund Freud}

With the above commands, the long title "The Psychopathology of
Everyday Life" appears only in the first (title) slide, while the
short title "Psychopathology" appears in each slide at the bottom
portion. Similarly, the full name "Sigmund Freud" is displayed only in
the title slide, while in the remaining slides, the author name will
be displayed in short form as "S. Freud".

Note: The template uses default font provided by beamer. If you have 
the complete LaTeX package installed, it is recommended to use the 
font Libertine for the slides. The font can be included using the 
following line at the beginning of the file 'pres.tex'.
	
\usepackage{libertine}


3. Writing Theorems, Proofs, Lemmas, Definitions, Remarks,
-----------------------------------------------------------
Assumptions, and Propositions
------------------------------

For writing different math environments such as theorems and proofs,  
the following environments are defined and will be displayed in 
blocks.

    Theorem     :    \begin{theorem} ... \end{theorem}
    Proof       :    \begin{proof} ... \end{proof}             
    Lemma       :    \begin{lemma} ... \end{lemma}
    Assumption  :    \begin{assumption} ... \end{assumption}
    Proposition :    \begin{proposition} ... \end{proposition}
    Definition  :    \begin{definition} ... \end{definition}
    Remarks     :    \begin{remark} ... \end{remark}


4. Adding bibliography
----------------------

Unlike reports, where the list of references appears at the last part
of your document, the current theme uses in-frame citations, where the
references appear as footnotes on the same slide where you are
referring the source. For the same, the theme includes a file
'pres.bib' to provide the BibTeX entries of all your citations. Two
major differences in the current theme (from regular articles) for
using citations are as follows:

 (a) Use '\footfullcite{}' instead of '\cite{}'

     Note: If you are citing within a block or within a column, use
     commands '\footnotemark' and '\footnotetext{\fullcite{}}'. 

 (b) Use '\addbibresource{pres.bib}' to include bibliography file in
     your slides as the replacement for '\bibliography{}' used in
     regular articles (This command is already added at the beginning
     of 'pres.tex').


5. Building the LaTeX Source
----------------------------

If you have installed the tool 'latexmk', just build 'pres.tex' using
latexmk. Otherwise, you need to follow the default LaTeX building
process using the following steps:

1. Build pres.tex using pdflatex
2. Build pres.bib using bibtex
3. Build pres.tex using pdflatex (2 times)
